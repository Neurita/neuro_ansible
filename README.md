# neuro_deploy

This Ansible project is to develop and deploy the Neuroimaging tools for Neuro-Pypes.


## Installation

You need a Python environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
pipenv install
```


## Running

To configure and deploy in a remote machine, do:

```bash
./playbook.yml -l neuro --extra-vars="ansible_host=<ip_address> ansible_user=<user_name> n_cpus=4" -K
```

Have a look at the [ansible-playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.4/ansible-playbook.html#ansible-playbook) instructions for more details on how to use the command line.


## Testing

This project includes a Vagrantfile.
With `vagrant` you can launch a
Debian VM and provision it with this project.

For that, do:

```bash
vagrant up
```

## Docker image

It is possible to create a Docker image with Ubuntu provisioned with the neuroimaging tools through this project.
For that to work you need to install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) and run:

```bash
make docker-image
```

This command will export a file name `neuro_docker.tar.lz4` which is a compressed docker image that can be imported.


## Docker run

Another option is to use the command:

```bash
make docker-run
```

which will provision a new local running container.
